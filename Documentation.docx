📖 Technical Documentation: CareerPulse AI
1. Executive Summary
CareerPulse AI is a smart application designed to streamline the job application process. It uses AI-driven logic to "compress" voluminous job descriptions into digestible insights and provides strategic resume alignment tips to help users beat Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

2. Technical Architecture
The project is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using a "Low-Code" approach for high performance and minimal latency.

Core Stack
Engine: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).

Styling: Tailwind CSS (Utility-first framework).

UI Pattern: Glassmorphism / Dark Mode Dashboard.

Typography: Plus Jakarta Sans (loaded via Google Fonts).

Component Logic
Component | Function | Implementation -- | -- | -- Input Controller | Captures JD and Resume strings. | document.getElementById Animation Engine | Manages loading and pulse states. | Tailwind animate-pulse Template Engine | Injects AI results into the DOM. | JS Template Literals
3. Implementation Details
UI/UX Design Decisions
The Split-Screen Layout: We utilize a 5:7 grid ratio (lg:grid-cols-12). This allows users to view their inputs on the left while reading the AI-generated results on the right without scrolling.

Color Theory: * Indigo ($#6366f1$): Represents the employer/Job Description.

Purple ($#a855f7$): Represents the candidate/Resume.

Emerald ($#10b981$): Indicates success and actionable "tips."

Glassmorphism: The backdrop-filter: blur(10px) effect is used to create a "layered" UI that feels like modern desktop software rather than a flat website.

Processing Logic (The "Compression" Algorithm)
In the current version, the compression is simulated via a asynchronous event handler:

Event Trigger: click event on analyzeBtn.

State Management: The button is disabled to prevent multiple submissions.

Data Rendering: The output area is dynamically updated using the .innerHTML property to transform raw data into formatted cards and lists.

4. API Integration Strategy
To move from a prototype to a production-ready application, the setTimeout block should be replaced with a real LLM integration (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro).

Recommended API Flow:

Request: Send a JSON payload containing the jdInput and resumeInput.

Prompt Engineering: Use a system prompt to define the "Compression" constraints (e.g., "Summarize in 3 sentences, identify 5 keywords").

Response Handling: Parse the JSON response and map it to the UI components.

5. Maintenance and Customization
Changing Themes: You can update the primary gradient by modifying the from-indigo-600 to-purple-600 classes in the HTML.

Expanding Inputs: New fields (like Cover Letter input) can be added to the lg:col-span-5 section.

Performance: All assets (Tailwind, Fonts) are loaded via CDN for maximum speed, requiring no local node_modules installation.

6. Glossary
ATS (Applicant Tracking System): Software used by employers to scan resumes for keywords.

JD (Job Description): The official list of requirements for a role.

Compression: The process of removing "fluff" from a JD to reveal the true hiring intent.
